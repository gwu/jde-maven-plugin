jde-maven-plugin - A maven plugin for Emacs JDE users.


    This project contains a plugin for maven that integrates with the
    Emacs JDE package.  In particular, the jde:jde goal generates a
    JDE project file (named prj.el by default) in the ${basedir} of
    the maven project.  The JDE project file is read automatically by
    the Emacs JDE package when a Java file is opened.  It contains the
    list of directories containing the source code, classes, jars, and
    javadoc files for the project and its dependencies.

    Think of it like the eclipse:eclipse goal for Emacs JDE.


To build the plugin:

    First, clone and install the gwu-lisp maven artifact.  See
    http://github.com/gwu/gwu-lisp for instructions.

    Run 'mvn package' to build target/jde-maven-plugin-${version}.jar.


To install the plugin:

    Run 'mvn install' to install to your local maven repository.


After installing, to use the plugin in another maven project:

    Run 'mvn com.garrettwu.maven.plugins:jde-maven-plugin:jde' to
    generate a 'prj.el' file.


Customizing behavior:

    By default, only direct dependencies are fetched and included in
    generated prj.el. To include transitive dependencies as well, add
    '-Djde.transitive.mode=true' to the command in the previous
    section. To make this the default behavior, add the following
    to your ~/.m2/settings.xml:

    <profiles>
      <profile>
        <id>jde-maven-plugin</id>
        <properties>
          <jde.transitive.mode>true</jde.transitive.mode>
        </properties>
      </profile>
    </profiles>
    <activeProfiles>
      <activeProfile>jde-maven-plugin</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>

    See com.garrettwu.maven.plugins.jde.JdeMojo.java for other
    properties and their usage.
