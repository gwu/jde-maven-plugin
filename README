     jde-maven-plugin - A maven plugin for Emacs JDE users.


This project contains a plugin for maven that integrates with the
Emacs JDE package.  In particular, the jde:jde goal generates a JDE
project file (named prj.el by default) in the ${basedir} of the maven
project.  The JDE project file is read automatically by the Emacs JDE
package when a Java file is opened.  It contains the list of
directories containing the source code, classes, jars, and javadoc
files for the project and its dependencies.

Think of it like the eclipse:eclipse goal for Emacs JDE.
