Bugs:

* Javadoc artifacts are unpacked to a directory named according to the
  artifactId.  If a project depends on two artifacts with the same
  artifactId, some javadoc files may be clobbered.


Features:

* Resolve javadoc directories using an external configuration file, so
  users can manually specify a javadoc directory or URL even if there
  was no javadoc artifact published to the repository.

* Resolve source directories using an external configuration file, so
  users can manually specify a source directory even if there was no
  source artifact published to the repository.

* Make the prj.el file more readable (pretty-print the generated lisp).
